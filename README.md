# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to help the client to decifer what and who can be considered for good loans versus risky loans; the dataset chosen for this endeavor is a credit card dataset from LendingClub. This analysis will be utilizing machine-learning models from imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling to predict credit risk. 

## Results 
For thoroughness 6 different machine learning models have been used to predict the credit risk.

1.) RandomOverSample (Oversampling Resampling Model)

2.) SMOTE (Oversampling Resampling Model)

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
